# Hotseat Bot
In some of Purdue CS classes, they use a discussion tool called Hotseat. This allows students to post/reply to various threads in real time. 
I made this bot with the intention of familiarizing myself with the Selenium framework, while also seeing what fun things I could do in the Hotseat discussion.

*No hotseat discussions were harmed in the making of this bot.*
